**Notes**
- You must have a good (intermediate) coding (specifically: Python) skills. It is important for you to modify and add stuff to.

- Have discord.py library installed/imported.
- You must credit me because yeah I made this thingy (seriously)

## 1. Install/Import Python and needed libraries.
- Because I don't have a PC so I can't give out screenshot. I'm just gonna list down:
discord, os, JSON, aiohttp, dotenv, asyncio. (install these with PIP).
- The others I already imported in the file.

## 2. Download code.
- Self-explanatory. Install the source code in Releases or Code section on this repo.

## 3. Do stuff
- Yeah now you can do anything you want with the code now.
- You can modify, use, contribute,... stuff.
